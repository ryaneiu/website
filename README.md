# React-2-Pytailred monorepo

## We are building a Reddit-inspired web application using a modern full-stack setup. (only 2 workers, Ryan (@ryaneiu), and Cari, (@CariLT01))

# Setup

Frontend: see `apps/frontend/web/README.md`
Backend: see `apps/backend/README.md`
Login page: see `apps/frontend/web-login/README.md`

# Tech Stack

Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: React + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Runtime: Node.js

Hosting: PythonAnywhere (backend)

The frontend communicates with the backend through a REST API.
Authentication, hashing, and core logic are handled on the Django side.
