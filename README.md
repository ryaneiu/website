# React-2-Pytailred monorepo

## We are building a Reddit-inspired web application using a modern full-stack setup. This website will later have more functionality than its counterpart. The objective of this website is to make some kind of Reddit at school [lucille-teasdale.ecoles.csmv.gouv ](https://lucille-teasdale.ecoles.csmv.qc.ca/) since reddit is blocked at school. This is a DRF backend with argon2 hashing with JWT cookies (Soon™) and a React + Tailwind + Vite frontend. Our website is fully SPA and currently not deployed. (only 2 developers, Ryan (@ryaneiu), and Cari, (@CariLT01)) Ryan currently is the host of this project and is working on the backend

# Setup

Frontend: see `apps/frontend/web/README.md`
Backend: see `apps/backend/README.md`
Login page: see `apps/frontend/web-login/README.md`

# Tech Stack

Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: React + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Runtime: Node.js

Hosting: PythonAnywhere (backend)

The frontend communicates with the backend through a REST API.
Authentication, hashing, and core logic are handled on the Django side.
