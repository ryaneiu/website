## We are building a Reddit-inspired web application using a modern full-stack setup.

# Tech Stack

Backend: Django (Python)

Frontend: React + Vite

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Runtime: Node.js

Hosting: PythonAnywhere (backend)

The frontend communicates with the backend through a REST API.
Authentication, hashing, and core logic are handled on the Django side.
